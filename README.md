    Thursday

        
        Winter Holidays, are a time to rest and enjoy peace.
        You know, even if I were a demon girl. I still need to take a bit of a rest sometimes.
        I don't mean eating human souls. 
        I just love to take a bath and relax sometimes.
        I saw a random man trying to force me to enter a pub.
        Even though I'm pretty sure what he wants.
        I still went with him.
        Then ate his soul.
        It wasn't too good, I promise you that.
        Hope you have a nice day!!!
